# Advanced Python Generators for Large Datasets

## Project Overview

This project introduces advanced usage of Python generators to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations. The tasks focus on leveraging Python’s `yield` keyword to implement generators that provide iterative access to data, promoting optimal resource utilization, and improving performance in data-driven applications.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- **Master Python Generators**: Learn to create and utilize generators for iterative data processing, enabling memory-efficient operations.
- **Handle Large Datasets**: Implement batch processing and lazy loading to work with extensive datasets without overloading memory.
- **Simulate Real-world Scenarios**: Develop solutions to simulate live data updates and apply them to streaming contexts.
- **Optimize Performance**: Use generators to calculate aggregate functions like averages on large datasets, minimizing memory consumption.
- **Apply SQL Knowledge**: Use SQL queries to fetch data dynamically, integrating Python with databases for robust data management.

## Requirements

To complete this project, you'll need:

- **Proficiency in Python 3.x**
- **Understanding of `yield` and Python’s generator functions**
- **Familiarity with SQL and database operations** (MySQL and SQLite)
- **Basic knowledge of database schema design and data seeding**
- **Ability to use Git and GitHub for version control and submission**

## Project Structure

This project includes several tasks that cover different aspects of data processing with generators, such as:

1. **Using Generators to Stream Data**: Fetch and process data one row at a time to minimize memory usage.
2. **Batch Processing**: Process data in manageable chunks or batches to improve performance and reduce resource consumption.
3. **Lazy Loading and Pagination**: Efficiently load data only when needed using pagination techniques.
4. **Computing Aggregates with Generators**: Calculate functions like averages without loading all data into memory at once.
5. **Simulating Live Data Streams**: Simulate real-time data fetching and processing, useful for applications involving live data updates.
