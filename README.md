# Advanced Python: Generators, Decorators, Context Managers, and Asynchronous Programming

## Objective

The goal of this project is to deepen your Python programming knowledge by exploring advanced techniques, including generators, decorators, context managers, and asynchronous programming. These concepts enable you to write more efficient, readable, and maintainable code, particularly in scenarios involving large data processing, resource management, and concurrent execution.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. **Generators: Creating Iterators with Generators**

Generators are a special type of iterator in Python, designed to yield values one at a time. This allows for efficient memory usage and lazy evaluation, making it ideal for large datasets.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Generator Functions**: Defined like regular functions but use `yield` to return data.
- **Generator Expressions**: Similar to list comprehensions but produce generator objects.

#### Examples:

**Generator Function**:
```python
def firstn(n):
    num = 0
    while num < n:
        yield num
        num += 1
```

**Generator Expression**:
```python
squares = (x * x for x in range(10))
```

#### Benefits:
- **Memory Efficiency**: Only one item is produced at a time, reducing memory usage.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Values are computed as needed, ideal for handling large data sets.

### 2. **Decorators: Modifying Functions and Methods**

Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of another function or method. They can be used to add, modify, or extend the behavior of the original function without altering its code.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Basic Decorator Structure**: A decorator function typically wraps another function using an inner wrapper function.
- **Decorator with Arguments**: Decorators can handle functions with varying arguments by using `*args` and `**kwargs`.

#### Examples:

**Simple Decorator**:
```python
def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function call")
        func()
        print("After function call")
    return wrapper

@decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")
```

**Decorator with Arguments**:
```python
def do_twice(func):
    def wrapper_do_twice(*args, **kwargs):
        func(*args, **kwargs)
        func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper_do_twice

@do_twice
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello {name}")
```

#### Benefits:
- **Code Reusability**: Apply the same behavior across multiple functions.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep the core logic separate from cross-cutting concerns like logging or access control.

### 3. **Context Managers: Managing Resources with the `with` Statement**

Context managers ensure that resources are properly acquired and released, typically using the `with` statement. This is especially useful for handling file operations, network connections, or locks.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Class-based Context Managers**: Implemented using `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.
- **Context Manager using `contextlib`**: A more succinct way to create context managers using decorators and generator functions.

#### Examples:

**Class-based Context Manager**:
```python
class File:
    def __init__(self, filename, method):
        self.file_obj = open(filename, method)

    def __enter__(self):
        return self.file_obj

    def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):
        self.file_obj.close()

with File('demo.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Hello World!')
```

**Context Manager using `contextlib`**:
```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def open_file(name):
    f = open(name, 'w')
    try:
        yield f
    finally:
        f.close()

with open_file('demo.txt') as f:
    f.write('Hello World!')
```

#### Benefits:
- **Automatic Resource Management**: Ensures resources like files and network connections are properly closed after use.
- **Cleaner Code**: Reduces boilerplate code and improves readability.

### 4. **Asynchronous Programming: Implementing Async Functions and Coroutines**

Asynchronous programming allows for non-blocking code execution, enabling tasks to run concurrently. Python’s `asyncio` library provides tools to write asynchronous code using `async` and `await` keywords, making it suitable for IO-bound tasks like web servers and network communication.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Coroutines**: Functions defined with `async def` that can be paused and resumed.
- **Event Loop**: Manages the execution of coroutines and other asynchronous tasks.
- **Concurrency with `asyncio`**: Running multiple coroutines concurrently without multithreading.

#### Examples:

**Basic Coroutine**:
```python
import asyncio

async def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello {name}")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print(f"Goodbye {name}")

asyncio.run(greet("World"))
```

**Running Multiple Coroutines**:
```python
async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(
        greet("Alice"),
        greet("Bob"),
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Benefits:
- **Improved Performance**: Particularly in IO-bound tasks, as the program doesn’t have to wait for operations like file reading or network requests to complete.
- **Efficient Concurrency**: Handles many tasks simultaneously without the overhead of threading.
