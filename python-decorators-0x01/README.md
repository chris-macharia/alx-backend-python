# Python Decorators for Database Operations

This project focuses on mastering Python decorators to enhance database operations in Python applications. Through hands-on tasks, you will create custom decorators to log queries, handle connections, manage transactions, retry failed operations, and cache query results. These tasks simulate real-world challenges, providing an in-depth understanding of Python's capabilities for dynamic and reusable code in database management.

---

## **Learning Objectives**

By completing these tasks, you will:

1. Deepen your knowledge of Python decorators and their role in creating reusable, efficient, and clean code.
2. Enhance database management skills by automating repetitive tasks like connection handling, logging, and caching.
3. Implement robust transaction management techniques to ensure data integrity and handle errors gracefully.
4. Optimize database queries by leveraging caching mechanisms to reduce redundant calls.
5. Build resilience into database operations by implementing retry mechanisms for transient errors.
6. Apply best practices in database interaction for scalable and maintainable Python applications.

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.8 or higher installed.
- MYSQL database setup with a `user_data` table for testing.
- A working knowledge of Python decorators and database operations.
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub for project submission.
- Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

---

## **Key Highlights**

### **Task 0: Logging Database Queries**
- **Objective**: Create a decorator to log all SQL queries executed by a function.
- **Learning**: Intercept function calls to enhance observability.

---

### **Task 1: Handle Database Connections with a Decorator**
- **Objective**: Automate database connection handling with a decorator.
- **Learning**: Eliminate boilerplate code for opening and closing connections.

---

### **Task 2: Transaction Management Decorator**
- **Objective**: Implement a decorator to manage database transactions (commit/rollback).
- **Learning**: Ensure robust error handling and data consistency.

---

### **Task 3: Retry Database Queries**
- **Objective**: Build a decorator to retry database operations on failure.
- **Learning**: Introduce resilience against transient database issues.

---

### **Task 4: Cache Database Queries**
- **Objective**: Implement a decorator to cache query results.
- **Learning**: Optimize performance by avoiding redundant database calls.

## **Setup**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

3. Set up an SQLite3 database with a `users` table for testing:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       name TEXT NOT NULL,
       email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
       age INTEGER
   );
   ```

4. Install any necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## **Usage**

Each task is implemented as a separate Python script. Follow the instructions in each script to test the decorators.

- Run the scripts directly:
   ```bash
   python task0_log_queries.py
   python task1_handle_connections.py
   python task2_transaction_management.py
   python task3_retry_queries.py
   python task4_cache_queries.py
   ```

- Modify the provided example functions and database queries to explore different scenarios.
